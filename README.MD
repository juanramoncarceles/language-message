# INSTRUCTIONS

Serve the folder files with a server.

Open localhost, if your browser is in inglish nothing will be suggested, because the plain url without lang code correspond to the english version

however if the browser is set to another language like spanish a link will appear to redirect to the spanish version.


there are three index.html test files under lang folders to test it.

For example open localhost/zh-hans/index.html and if your browser is not in chinese a link will be shown with the link to the website in your browser's lang.
