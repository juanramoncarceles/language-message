☐ Change format to just two buttons: "Ver en Español", "Continue in English", and in both cases? it saves a cookie with the selected option. The cross does nothing, just closes.

☐ If no reference HTML element is found the scroll event listener could be removed? To make script more efficient.

☐ ResizeObserver doesn't exist in old Edge, use a library instead (https://github.com/juggle/resize-observer). @critical 

☐ Use transform instead of top left for better performance because they don't cause repaint?

☐ When starting scrolling down updatePosition is called simultaneously from scroll event and resizeObserver making it display wrong on Chrome. @high 
  Use transform property instead?

☐ Two seconds delay before it appears. It works locally but not on the deployed.

☐ How would it work if I fetch the info of the availble languages each time? The array of lang objects would be different.

☐ Check how it looks from a smartphone.

☐ If the reference element moves the tooltip doesn't update the position. To check if it moved the getBoundingClientRect() values should be checked periodically.

☐ Resize obersever only is called if the target element changes its content-box so there are limitations.


✔ Add cookies to not show the tooltip and possibly redirect if the user already made a decision @high @done(20-06-15 13:45)
  If the user checks the 'Don't ask me again' and clicks either the close or the link a cookie is stored dontAskLang=true
    If the user clicks the cross nothing more is done.
    If the user clicks on the link then the language on the link (browser lang) is stored as 'preferredLang'
